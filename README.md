# Project Title
Project: Degen Token (ERC-20)


## Description

Create a ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming. The smart contract should have the following functionality:
Minting new tokens: The platform should be able to create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards. Only the owner can mint tokens.
Transferring tokens: Players should be able to transfer their tokens to others.
Redeeming tokens: Players should be able to redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store.
Checking token balance: Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
Burning tokens: Anyone should be able to burn tokens, that they own, that are no longer needed.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., DegenToken.sol).

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.26" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile DegenToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "DegenToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it. Click on the "DegenToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve.
